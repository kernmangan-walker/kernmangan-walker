    <h1><b>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</b></h1>
    My personal values are very much focused on altruism, having a sense of purpose, seeking to create a positive impact on the world around me, as well as the lives of the people and creatures that inhabit it. I see honesty and integrity as a key part of my value set as well, that I want to do what I say and live a life that can create net benefit. As part of this framework, I see compassion and empathy as fundamentally important, both for oneself and for others. In many ways, this compassion for myself and others is the bedrock of being able to live an altruistic life. Family is also really important to me, with a big focus in my life on being together with family and offering support to each other. Over the past year since my mother got sick and eventually passed away, this has become particularly important. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1><b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</b><br>
    One example of an ethics-based decision I made was recently when my aunty told me about a health problem that her daughter (my cousin) had. I was aware that another relative had the same health condition and had to consider whether I should share this with my aunty as I felt like she would be able to convey this to my cousin, to reassure her as well as facilitate my cousin and my other relative being able to support each other. In terms of a decision, I had to weigh up whether telling my aunty would be a positive thing and contribute to better outcomes for my family members or whether it had the potential to violate the trust of my relative when it came to telling me about their health condition. My other relative hadn’t told me explicitly that they were comfortable with me telling anyone else but I felt like from their perspective they would have been fine with it, especially in the context of supporting another family member. In the end I did tell my aunty, who passed the information onto my cousin - I let my other relative know that I had told my aunty and they were really glad that I did. It allowed them to have a conversation about it and offer each other support and comfort. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1><b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b><br>
    Looking back on my upbringing, I was raised to see acting in services of others and the environment as crucial to my identity and values. Both of my parents were previously involved with the anti-racism protests, feminist movement and the anti-nuclear groundswell of the 1980s. They encouraged me to develop similar values and see acts of resistance, action and social movements as crucial parts of positive societal change. My mother in particular held strong values around her identity as a Pākehā in Aotearoa/NZ with a deep interest in post-colonial theory as well as deconstructing systemic racism. She was fluent in Te Reo and spent many years as a disability support worker, alongside Maori families across NZ. Looking further back, my Grandfather had a strong sense of fighting against injustice and held some beliefs (loosely based on evidence) that the family name Mangan, came from an old Gaelic origin meaning “the hand that stands against tyranny”. I always thought, despite how uncertain I was in the truth of this origin, that this was a really interesting set of values inscribed in the language relating to my family name. In some ways this has influenced my own perceptions of social justice and the importance of fairness throughout my life - with an awareness that coming from a relatively privileged position means that there is a responsibility to deconstruct some of the factors that contributed to that privilege existing in the first place. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1><b>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</b><br>
    Based on the various personality tests I have done (Strengths Finder, DiSC, Meyers Briggs) I have some strengths in building interpersonal relationships, coming up with ideas, leadership, problem-solving, creativity, being a constant learner and in understanding other people’s perspectives. In terms of limitations I have some major limitations when it comes to time management, planning ahead, staying focused on tasks, considering some smaller details and maintaining emotional stability at times. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1><b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development and Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</b><br>
    I think many of my strengths are really positive for my learning journey and career development, helping me to overcome many of the challenges that people face in both a workplace context as well as education. I am confident that being able to solve problems well, working together confidently with others, creativity, leadership and being focused on constantly learning give me an advantage in some areas. This has the potential to allow me to continue growing as both a hands-on team member as well as a leader. In terms of my limitations, I guess I see them as areas that don’t come naturally (or I haven’t developed yet) so can be things to focus on developing further. Some of these are fairly crucial in terms of being a developer, particularly time management, attention to detail as well as staying focused on tasks and emotional stability. These are areas that I will need to put close attention to throughout my journey as a developer and ongoing career path.

    <h1><b>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</b><br>
    One really notable example of this was during my time at an NGO in Melbourne where I was working closely with an older, far more experienced colleague and was responsible for managing them throughout the time we were employed there. They were unhappy with some new initiatives that I was introducing when it came to a major marketing campaign and thought that things should stay just how they had been for the past few years. They would sometimes make offhand negative comments to me and about the changes that I was suggesting. At the time I made the decision to focus on building a better relationship with my colleague, getting to know them more, understanding where they were coming from and showing them that I appreciated their vast wealth of experience. This worked well and we ended up going on regular coffee/beer meetings, where we got to know each other and they told me that they just wanted to feel valued in the workplace and their contributions appreciated, something which they didn’t see me as doing at the beginning, as I was a new less experienced staff member introducing new ideas.
