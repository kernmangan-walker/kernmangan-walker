<h1><b> What is the DOM (document object model)? </h1></b>
<br>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a sort of representation of the objects (pieces) that comprise the structure and content webpage. It functions as an interface or visual tool that allows people to see the different HTML, CSS and Javascript of a webpage. It also allows them to make edits to the HTML, Javascript and CSS elements. It is through the DOM that Javascript scripting to a given webpage that you are able to access elements, make changes and alter the page. In order to access different elements of a webpage and make changes, you can run scripts through Javascript that will search for and allow you to manipulate parts of the page. These scripts allow you to search for and manipulate nodes or objects that are in both the Window and Document of the webpage. This can be done by running Javascript commands in the DOM console, using scripts to make changes to the page and executing them. Some of these scripts are specifically tailored for accessing and manipulating the DOM. These changes are then reflected in the local version of the webpage but not the remote version, although you can save versions of the webpage HTML, CSS and Javascript code for you to make edits to yourself. 
<br>
<br>
<h1><b> What is the dfference Between HTML, CSS and Javascript in an analogy?</h1></b>
<br>
If these supplementary front-end code languages were a house (representing a webpage or web app):
<br>
HTML: The foundations and the structure, the pillars and supports that makeup core parts of the building, as well as the blueprints for construction.
CSS: Features of the house, the wallpaper, the tiles on the floor, the carpet, the non-structural walls that define rooms and spaces.
Javascript: The functional elements of the house, the appliances, the furniture, the light switches, the power plugs, everything that you can actually use and interact with as a person.
<br>
<br>
<h1><b>What are Control Flows and Loops, what is an analogy from every day life?</h1></b>
<br>
Control flows are the order of which a person’s code is “run” and whether certain parts are acknowledged, ignored, skipped, or if there are certain conditions that need to be met for some code to be run. Loops, conditions, and functions are the way for control flow to be established.  An everyday analogy of this in everyday life would be the way you go through the day, the decision making you have around when to do what and if you want to do certain activities. Maybe you’re just having a day off, so you just exist as normal, relaxing, or maybe you’ve got a busy day with lots of changes from your regular schedule. 
<br>
Loops are a way to run code repetitively, but each time with a different value or set of conditions. It’s essentially a way to create a miniature simulation with code being run but each time with a different set of numbers of values involved - so hypothetically you could create a range of numbers, then apply a specific set of conditionals (code calculations) that run creating different outputs (numbers or values spat out) each time. 
An everyday analogy of this might be thinking and practising saying something you feel uncertain about over and over again. Maybe you’ve got a speech tomorrow and want to practice a few times to get parts of it right, trying different approaches. While most of the speech is the same, you just want to add in that special little bit extra, maybe some key words to create a real zinger.
<br>
<br>
<h1><b>What are Functions and why are they useful?</h1></b>
<br>
Functions are an amazing part of Javascript that allows you to define a specific block of code that performs different tasks or calculations. It needs to have a specific input, some interaction with that input and output as well. Functions always have curly brackets like this {} with the function existing within those brackets, but also interacting with code outside of them. They are useful because they essentially define many of the “things” that happen within a Javascript script, representing an action occurring with a given cause, interaction and response.
