    <h1><b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b></h1><br><br>
    
    1. I am definitely more capable of dealing with challenges both during my studies and externally than I thought, I feel more resourceful than I had thought.<br>
    2. I am still not great at time management and prone to distraction, especially when the challenges are related to my emotions. <br>
    3. I am pretty dedicated and still capable of overnighters when I need to be. Feel like I’ve rebuilt a pretty significant store of backup energy that I can access when things feel overwhelming. <br>
    <h1><b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</b></h1><br><br>
    
    I think these things are absolutely essential for working with others, understanding ourselves as functional human beings and working to achieve our goals. <b>Values</b> help to define our direction, how we behave, what we will/won’t do and defining them helps to set a standard for who we are and who we want to be in the future. <b>Empathy</b> is essential for working with others, building relationships, understanding where people are coming from, mitigating conflict and seeing challenges from external perspectives - all of which can be extremely valuable. <b>Self-awareness</b> is really important as well as it allows us to perceive our strengths, weaknesses, what motivates us and how we can best work to achieve our goals. 
    <h1><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b></h1><br><br>
    
    Probably the fact that it was such a big focus at all was pretty amazing. I’m a huge fan of self-improvement as a concept and having guidance on ways to achieve this and how to constantly build upon ourselves as human beings was a very cool experience. <br><br>
    <h1><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b></h1><br><br>
    
    Well the emotional intelligence part was kind of a wake-up call and a very positive one at that. I had always just (wrongly) assumed that I had great emotional intelligence, but on reflection and study on this specific area, I came to the realisation that there was so much more to be learned. This was a really wonderful epiphany as it allowed me to see what areas I was lacking in and how I could further develop these. This has been something that I have been readily working on in my own time, through how I relate to myself and others, along with further study. <br><br>
    
    
    <h1><b>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b></h1><br><br>
    
    Because while these skills are essential for all humans, they are particularly sought after and valued within the programming space. From my own experience of working in tech in various roles, I’ve seen how important they are and how valuable they can be. As a business owner myself I’d absolutely focus on this as an important area to consider when hiring staff. Generally, the skills that were focused on throughout core are things that I would see as super important to many different roles, in many different workplaces, through all parts of a person’s life. Growing these skillsets and expanding this sort of knowledge makes us better, more effective and more altruistic human beings - which is awesome!
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b></h1><br><br>
    
    Absolutely not - it made me realise how much more I have to learn in these areas. I had assumed that I had (semi) mastered a lot of these things, but I truly hadn’t, which I see as a deeply valuable realisation. While the extra time focused on programming would have been useful, I don’t think core really took up that much time overall and I feel as though the contributions it made to people’s learning outcomes (and my own) more than justifies the time it required to complete.
