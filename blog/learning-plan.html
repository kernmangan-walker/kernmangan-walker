          <h1><b>Bootcamp Learning Plan (UPDATED!)</h1></b>
          <br><br>

          <h1><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1></b><br><br>
          In terms of a long-term goal, I’d say that my focus is on building businesses with positive environmental and
          social impacts using technology. For me learning to code is a key element of that and I see dev academy as
          part of a wider learning journey that I hope will lead into multiple other code languages, while allowing me
          to build websites, apps and tools that faciliate this growth.
          <br><br>
          <h1><b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1></b><br><br>
          Probably one of my biggest weaknesses is around getting distracted easily and struggling to plan ahead
          effectively. Learning how to timebox properly is a key element of this and something that I intend to include
          as a key focus area throughout my time at dev academy. Additionally, I also have some issues with emotional
          instability and feeling down quite regularly. I intend to manage this carefully and make sure I do several
          positive, uplifting things each day to maintain an even keel.
          <br>
          After doing foundations I’d say my biggest strength is going to be pushing through and getting things done,
          even when it feels extremely challenging if not impossible. I feel like I’ve done well given the challenges
          I’ve faced during this time and still managed to complete at least the bare minimum - which is an achievement
          given that a lot of my time was taken up by external factors.
          <br>
          <br>

          <h1><b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1></b><br><br>

          I would say definitely time management and not getting distracted by other things that feel urgent. I guess I
          really need to focus on building up my skills around this and ability to focus as I am committed to succeeding
          at the course and it sits at a high priority for me.

          <br><br>
          <h1><b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
              Academy?</h1></b><br><br>
          I think for me improving my time-management and planning skills would be a really powerful area to develop and
          help to overcome some of the current biggest weaknesses. Additionally I would say that it’s important for me
          to improve my emotional challenge, capacity to cope with stress and generally work alongside others in a
          high-pressure context.

          <br><br>
          <h1><b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1></b><br><br>
          I expect clear instructions about the tasks that need to be completed, timelines, as well as support and
          understanding when required.

          <br><br>
          <h1><b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1></b><br><br>
          That I will absolutely try my best to succeed - give my 110%, ask for help when I need to and always keep
          trying even when it seems difficult.
          <br><br>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include -
          an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
          facilitators and industry/community representatives.<br><br>

          I am entirely committed to succeeding in this program and will manage my workload by dedicating the next few
          months of my life to achieving the learning competencies. I’ll balance my time with careful scheduling and
          following healthy routines. I’ll take care of myself, others, listen to people and work to contribute towards
          a safe, comfortable environment for everyone involved with the course. I’ll always work with an open mind, an
          open heart, empathy and always try to understand other people’s perspectives. If I’m ever struggling or
          feeling frustrated, I’ll seek support readily and actively, trying to mitigate challenges before they become
          overwhelming.<br><br><br>
          <h1><b>Foundations Learning Plan</h1></b>

          In terms of a long-term goal, I’d say that my focus is on building businesses with positive environmental and
          social impacts using technology. For me learning to code is a key element of that and I see dev academy as

          <h1><b> What are yours strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</b></h1><br>
          Probably one of my biggest weaknesses is around getting distracted easily and struggling to plan ahead
          effectively. Learning how to timebox properly is a key element of this and something that I intend to include
          as a key focus area throughout my time at dev academy. Additionally, I also have some issues with emotional
          instability and feeling down quite regularly. I intend to manage this carefully and make sure I do several
          positive, uplifting things each day to maintain an even keel.
          <br>
          My biggest strength when it comes to learning is being really passionate about it and deeply enjoying the
          entire process. I love solving problems and can often be seen jumping up and down or exclaiming if I have
          overcome a challenge that had seemed insurmountable. Another key strength would be my capacity to collaborate
          with others. I think my empathy and focus on understanding and trying to see problems with other people’s
          perspective can be quite helpful in an educational context.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1><b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
              Academy?</b></h1><br>
          I think for me improving my time-management and planning skills would be a really powerful area to develop and
          help to overcome some of the current biggest weaknesses.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1><b>How will you manage your workload</b></h1><br>
          I’m committed to working fulltime on dev academy and despite my slow start (due to moving and family
          challenges), I believe that I’ll be able to catch up and apply myself throughout the week. Over the weekend I
          will ensure that I’m able to relax, have fun and take care of myself. Evenings will also be focused on
          achieving this self-care too.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1><b>What commitment do you make to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</b></h1><br>
          I'm 100% committed to seeking help when I get stuck on a task or am unable to complete it by the due date.
          Have already done this on a couple of occasions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1><b>What do you expect from the facilitation team?</b></h1><br>
          I expect clear instructions about the tasks that need to be completed, timelines, as well as support and
          understanding when required.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1><b>What other scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things do you
              have?</b></h1><br>
          Mostly have completely free time currently focused on dev academy but also have two businesses that I co-lead
          which may take up blocks of time on occasion. Theoretically, I should have at least 5 days on any given week
          <br>
