                    <h1><b>A Challenge I Faced and How I Solved It</h1></b>
                    <br>
                    Probably one of my biggest roadblocks on this last sprint was working through the different built-in
                    methods problems, where I had to think somewhat creatively around finding alternative ways to solve
                    the problems, beyond the example solutions given. At times I was stumped simply by how to make the
                    different pieces of code I created fit together and work to answer the questions correctly. Looking
                    at the example solutions I could see the basic building blocks of what was being done and how it
                    would work, but I didn’t really see the whole picture in terms of how to ensure these different
                    building blocks could be linked together in different ways.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1><b>How I Solved It</h1></b>
                    <br>
                    In this case I decided I would turn to the limitless power that is the world’s dominant search
                    engine - Google. After researching these different methods, looking into how they worked, how the
                    syntax should be structured, I built up enough confidence to test my learning on my half-constructed
                    code. After multiple hours of testing, trying different approaches and trying to understand the
                    errors I was receiving, I managed to successfully pass the test. Woo!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1><b>Some of my favorite Javascript problem solving tools include:</h1></b>
                    <br>
                    <b>Pseudo code</b> is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of
                    their code through simple line-by-line descriptions of what the code is supposed to do. The idea
                    with pseudo code is that they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what their programming
                    background or knowledge is, or familiarity with the project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>A basic example of pseudo code is:</b>
                    <br>Creating a basic random number generator
                    <br><mark>
                    function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) { <br>
                    return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
                    }</mark>
                    <br><br>
                    In Pseudocode this would be:
                        <br><mark>
                        // Define function with array of numbers that the range can be set between<br>
                        // Use Javascript function math.random to generate the the specific number<br>
                        // Output generated number</mark>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The Rubber Ducky Method</b> is all about explaining code you’ve worked on - describing how it
                    works, what every part of it is supposed to do, allowing you to think about your code more simply
                    and perceive it from a different perspective. The idea is that it would be as if you are speaking to
                    a rubber duck. Explaining something out loud gives you a chance to understand more clearly if it
                    makes perfect sense or not, see potential gaps in your approach and identify how they might be
                    resolved.
                    <br>
                    For many people this allows them to find solutions to problems and understand what may be
                    contributing to bugs before they go ahead and speak with colleagues - minimising interruption
                    amongst the team while also facilitating problem-solving.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Understanding Error Messages</b> is super useful approach for problem solving with code is to
                    look for and decipher the different error messages you might receive through testing or when your
                    dev environment tries to “run” the code. It’s really important to understand the different types of
                    error messages you might receive as well as knowing where you might be able to look for these
                    errors.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, you may receive an error referring to a specific line of code but this isn’t
                    necessarily the origin of the error as the elements on that line might be more specifically tied to
                    other elements elsewhere in your document. Usually by looking into the origin of the
                    variables/function/other elements on the line with the related error, you can have a look into where
                    the error might actually originate.
                    <br>
                    The three main types of errors that can occur with coding Javascript are:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Logical Errors:</b>
                    Apparently one of the most common error types, it relates to a bug with the program that causes it
                    to crash. Effectively the program is operating not as intended at all. It can be very difficult to
                    trace as the program can completely crash or exit, without clear directions to the error in
                    question.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Syntax Errors:</b>
                    Relate to an issue with the syntax, characters or formatting you are using. Basically means that the
                    program is unable to read the code you’ve written and won’t properly execute.
                    <br><br>
                   <b>Runtime Errors:</b>
                    This relates to code that the program (or interpreter) cannot understand. In these instances the
                    syntax might exist but there may be an element of code that is missing or in not included correctly
                    within an object that was intended to be executed.
